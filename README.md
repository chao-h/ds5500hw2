# Problem 2
## Choose and critique one of the visualization by one of your fellow classmates for HW 1 Problem 2 (distribution of income across countries and continents over time). Include a link to the original.

## Describe the visualization and how it is similar and/or different from yours. Is it easy to interpret? Does it effectively visualize what is being asked? Why or why not?
The visualization uses filled area plots. Viewer can easily see how GDP for each continent changes over time, and can also easily be used to compare the GDP differences between each continents. This is very different from mine which visualizes the geographical map directly. The method used in this visualization is more efficient for comparing the actual numbers over time, and effectively visualizes the question being asked. It, however, fails to visualize the data per country due to filled area plots are not effective in visualizing hundreds of groups.

# Problem 3
## Choose and critique one of the visualization by one of your fellow classmates for HW 1 Problem 3 (relationship between income, life expectancy, and child mortality over time). Include a link to the original.

## Describe the visualization and how it is similar and/or different from yours. Is it easy to interpret? Does it effectively visualize what is being asked? Why or why not?
This visualization uses an interactive scatter plot with animation over time while using different colors for each continent. Mine uses static line plots. While mine is easy to visualize the trend of each continent over time, this visualization is much more effective for comparing data point for each country. Although the comparison between continent is slightly more difficult to interpret, due to each continent uses different color for each data points, it also enables viewers to further look into the actual distribution. The use of interactive plot makes detailed information for each data point(country) able to be further investigated based on researchers' interest. Overall I think this is a very effective visualization.

# Problem 4
## Choose and fit one or more models to quantify the relationship betweem income (GDP per capita) and life expectancy over time. Justify your choice of model and comment on its appropriateness. (You are not required to handle the autocorrelation of time series, but should comment on how this impacts your analysis.)
## Visualize the model(s) and comment on what they tell you about the relationship between income and life expectancy over time.
